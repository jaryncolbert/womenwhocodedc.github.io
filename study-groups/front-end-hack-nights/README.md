We're a group of women who want to learn JavaScript and everything front-end together. The study group is intended for everyone who wishes to learn JavaScript programming language, it's perfect for beginners with a basic understanding of HTML & CSS. If you already know JavaScript, this can be a great platform for you to get together with fellow developers and hone your skills. If you're advanced, we'd love for you to come and help others learn more.

There's always at least one mentor/leader present to help you with best practices or guide you through if you are stuck with a nasty problem!
